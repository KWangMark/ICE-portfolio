    "Large part of the data cleaning in NLP is associated with presenting the data in a consistent format and removing words without substantial semantic meanings. So, common data cleaning methods you can do include: make text lowercase, remove formats (e.g., html labels), remove punctuation, and remove words containing numbers. Some of them are easy (e.g., make everything lowercase) while some of them might be trickier depending on how pretty your data is.\n",
    "Anyway, for this particular example, let's just make all the text into lowercase, remove the punctunations, and remove the numbers. I am encapsulate the data cleaning all in one function called clean_text() and then map() this function to comment.\n",
    "When removing the punctuation, you will often find regular expression or regex a very handy tool to use if you want to automate this process. In fact, regex will be a great addition to your toolbox not only for NLP tasks, but pretty much any Data Science job involves data cleaning. There are a lot of great resources to learn it (e.g., https://developers.google.com/edu/python/regular-expressions), but I suggest you mastering it as you use it. No need to spend a lot of time perfecting a complicated tool that you won't use regularly (yes, regex involves a lot of tricks and can get quite complicated)."
